# Discrete-Mathematics


The Programming Assignment
Create a program that generates the truth table for the following expressions:
 
 1. (a+(a*(b+b)))*b
 
 2.(a+b*c)+a*(b+c)
 
 3. (a+b)*(a*c+a*c)+a*b+b
 
 4.(a*b*c*d)+(a*b*c*d)+(a*b*c*d)+(a*b*c*d)+(a*b*c*d)+(a*b*c*d)+(a*b*d) 
 
completing this assignment, be sure to do the following:
⦁	Ensure that the program loops over all permutations of truth values for the Boolean variables contained in each expression, calculate the truth value of the expression, and output a truth table.
⦁	You may hard-code these particular expressions into functions in your program
⦁	You don't need to write a string parser that can generate the truth table for an arbitrary Boolean expression (although it may be edifying to do so, should you seek additional challenge - but most of the work is in learning how to do string processing, which is beyond the scope of this class).
⦁	Simplify all the expressions by hand using the fundamental properties of Boolean algebra as far as you can.
⦁	Use your program to verify that your simplified versions have the same truth table as the originals.
⦁	Show your simplification work in comments in your source code.
